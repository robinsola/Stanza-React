### Description
An application to find poems, using [PoetryDB API](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb) and [POEMIST API](https://poemist.github.io/poemist-apidoc/). Choose from a list of topics by holiday, theme, occasion, and refine your search by adding an author. User may also choose to generate a random poem from the database. Save, store, collect your favorite poems for easy access. The goal is for the user to be able to use this easy poetry finder as a quick reference for inspiration in a situation where they are put on the spot to express themselves, give a short speech, or write a greeting in a card.

### MVP
* App will collect user input - selection of Holiday or theme, or submit author or keyword search.
* App will collect poems from the Poetry Database to display a list poems based on user search results - showing title, author, and poem content.

### Stretch Goals
* User will be able to generate a random poem from the database.
* User will be able to save and store favorite poems in a separate list.
* User will be able to log when, where, who with, and how many times they have used each of their saved poems in the wild (real world).
* User will be able to save and store a list of favorite authors to click on for quick access to a list of their poems.

### Brainstorming
mood:
* sleek, sexy-fresh, simple
* stanza, versify, versifier, sonnet, couplet, limerick

content & navigation:
* Logo / login form / register (probably won't have a user login)
* Nav bar: search / random poem / favorites
* Search form: theme: text / occasion: dropdown / author: text
* Poem marketplace: number of poems in search, list of poems with title / author / teaser
* Poem detail: title / author / lines / button to add to favorites / btn back to search results

icons:
* logo: ink bottle with feather pen
* search: magnify glass
* generate random poem: two arrows / shuffle icon
* list of favorites: heart with 3 lines / double hearts
* add to favorites: heart

colors:
* yellow / orange gradient
* white rgb(255, 255, 255)-#ffffff
* black rgb(0, 0, 0)-#000000
* drk gray rgb(58, 58, 58)-#3a3a3a
* lite gray rgb(109, 109, 109)-#6d6d6d

fonts:
* Lato, sans-serif (use for content)
* Dancing Script, cursive
* Sign Painter, cursive (use for logo)
* News Cycle, sans-serif
* Special Elite, cursive

### Planning / NOTES
*PoemSearch generates PoemList through API call*
1. Break up application into components:
App, LogoSplash, NavBar, PoemSearch, PoemList, Poem, FavPoemList, FavePoem
2. Create static UI without interactivity - passing data using props
3. Identify minimal, complete representation of state: App will be stateful because of its hierarchy: PoemList needs to fill with poems based on SearchPoems form submit
4. PoemList is changeable state that will be stored in App, making App stateful
5. Inverse data flow: Poem in PoemList will be filtered by click event to move Poem to new FavPoemList

*Below is a rough sketch of the component tree with a stateful router*
