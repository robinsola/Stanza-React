### Description
An application to find poems, using [PoetryDB API](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb). Choose from a list of topics by holiday, theme, occasion, or search by author. User may also choose to generate a random poem from the database. Save, store, collect your favorite poems and authors for easy access. The goal is for the user to be able to use this easy poetry finder as a quick reference for inspiration in a situation where they are put on the spot to express themselves or give a short speech.

### MVP
* App will collect user input - selection of Holiday or theme, or submit author or keyword search.
* App will collect poems from the Poetry Database to display a list poems base on user search results - showing title, author, and first line of poem.
* User will be able to click on single poems from the list to see full view of poem.

### Stretch Goals
* User will be able to generate a random poem from the database.
* User will be able to save and store favorite poems in a separate list.
* User will be able to log when, where, who with, and how many times they have used each of their saved poems in the wild (real world).
* User will be able to save and store a list of favorite authors to click on for quick access to a list of their poems.

### Brainstorming
mood:
* sleek, sexy-fresh, simple
* stanza, versify, versifier, sonnet, couplet, limerick

content & navigation:
* Logo / login form / register (probably won't have a user login)
* Nav bar: search / random poem / favorites
* Search form: theme: text / occasion: dropdown / author: text
* Poem marketplace: number of poems in search, list of poems with title / author / teaser
* Poem detail: title / author / lines / button to add to favorites / btn back to search results

icons:
* logo: ink bottle with feather pen
* search: magnify glass
* generate random poem: two arrows / shuffle icon
* list of favorites: heart with 3 lines / double hearts
* add to favorites: heart

colors:
* yellow / orange gradient
* white rgb(255, 255, 255)-#ffffff
* black rgb(0, 0, 0)-#000000
* drk gray rgb(58, 58, 58)-#3a3a3a
* lite gray rgb(109, 109, 109)-#6d6d6d

fonts:
* Lato, sans-serif (use for content)
* Dancing Script, cursive
* Sign Painter, cursive (use for logo)
* News Cycle, sans-serif
* Special Elite, cursive

### Planning / NOTES
*PoemSearch generates PoemList through API call*
1. Break up application into components:
App, LogoSplash, NavBar, PoemSearch, PoemList, Poem, FavPoemList, FavePoem
2. Create static UI without interactivity - passing data using props
3. Identify minimal, complete representation of state: App will be stateful because of its hierarchy: PoemList needs to fill with poems based on SearchPoems form submit
4. PoemList is changeable state that will be stored in App, making App stateful
5. Inverse data flow: Poem in PoemList will be filtered by click event to move Poem to new FavPoemList

*Below is a rough sketch of the component tree with a stateful router*
